I'm Stella, a MathFinance student at the University of Waterloo, passionate about mathematical research and quantitative finance. I enjoy solving complex puzzles and being creative. 

I'm currently at a sales and trading internship at Bank of America. I am working on prediction models and enhancement of existing frameworks. I am learning about transformers in deep learning and how they are leveraged in financial markets and trading.

<!--🔭 I’m currently working on a blog to expand my knowledge on data science, market research, web scraping and development.-->
