I'm Stella, a MathFinance student at the University of Waterloo, passionate about mathematical research, machine learning, and quantitative finance. I love solving complex puzzles and being creative. 

âœ¨ I'm currently in school and will be interning at Global X in a quantitative investment role in the winter term!

ðŸŒ± I am part of the DRP program led by Waterloo's WIM and learning/researching about algorithmic game theory.

ðŸ”­ I am learning about stochastic processes in class and am excited to apply that with what I am learning about machine learning/deep learning in projects!

<!--ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a blog to expand my knowledge on data science, market research, web scraping and development.-->
